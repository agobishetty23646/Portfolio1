NO SMASH 
Artifical Intelligence for Social Good Project

Overview: 
Chatbot that assists San Franciso residents about parking safety based on location and time. 
Features include multiple languages. 
Users can inquire about parking safety for a particular time, such as whether it's safe to park overnight or during street cleaning hours. 
The chatbot can provide reminders about parking restrictions based on the current time and location. 
Users should be able to interact with the chatbot in languages commonly spoken in the city, such as English, Spanish, Chinese, and others.

Project Summary: Worked with other members to develop chatbot to solve the objective of parking saftey in SF. Used Python code to develop chatbot along with streamlit for the user interface. 
Chatbot can help tourists and residents safely analyze where to park based on the data given to them by the chatbot.
